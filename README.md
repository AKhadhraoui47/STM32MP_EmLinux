## Say Cheez 📸  

We will take our first image, or build our first image i should say. First of we will follow the steps provided in this [Distribution Pckg](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/STM32MPU_Distribution_Package) to setup our environment.  

> If you're not familiar with **OpenSTLinux** distribution i recommend starting with the [Starter Pckg](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/STM32MP13_Discovery_kits_-_Starter_Package). Note that to deal efficiently with the distribution package, basic knowledge of **Yocto** is required, check this [repo](https://github.com/AKhadhraoui47/Yocto_Rpi_IMU?tab=readme-ov-file#yocto-project) where ressources are provided.  

After setting-up your workspace let's setup our build environment. A provided script in the package will do the work for us, we just need to source it with some parameters.  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ DISTRO=openstlinux-weston MACHINE=stm32mp13-disco IMAGE=st-image-core  source layers/meta-st/scripts/envsetup.sh build-dir-name
```
> Parameters are of my choice according to the hardware available to test everything is OK. Full list of provided parameters is [here](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/OpenSTLinux_distribution).  

> Mentionning the **build-dir-name** when sourcing the setup file is recommended to avoid any errors caused by path strings length.  

Sourcing the file will take us automatically to the build directory where we launch our build process with **bitbake**.  
```console
ak47@ak47:$ bitbake <image>
```
> In case we didn't mention the **IMAGE** parameter when sourcing our file we will have to mention it when launching the build.  

Once the build is complete, we will flash our **SD-Card**. Two ways will be covered; Our device in DFU Mode through USB OTG port or Flash the image directly to SD-Card from host machine but first let's check some key files under **DIR=build-dir/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/machine/**  

```
DIR --- arm-trusted-firmware/
    --- kernel/ 
    --- optee/
    --- fip/
    --- flashlayout_<IMAGE>/
    --- scripts/ 
```  

These directories contain the binaries of every element of our image, essential for a correct booting. You can check the [boot sequence](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/Boot_chain_overview#STM32MP13_boot_chain) for the MP13 series.  

> **scripts/** will be covered later. **flashlayout_<IMAGE>/** is used to locate binaries and set the partionning provided by **tsv** file used by **STM32CubeProgrammer**.

### DFU Mode  

To flash our image with our device set in DFU Mode we will need the right combination. An explanatory [table](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/STM32MP135x-DK_-_hardware_description#Boot_related_switches) is provided. <sub>Forced USB/UART boot
for programming</sub>  

Now let's flash the image using **STM32CubeProgrammer**. First let's check if our device is detected:  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ STM32_Programmer_CLI -l usb
Total number of available STM32 device in DFU mode: 1

  Device Index           : USB1
  USB Bus Number         : 
  USB Address Number     : 
  ...
```  

Now let's pass the **STM32CubeProgrammer** our device and the **tsv** file to flash our image on to the **SD-Card**.  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=usb1 -w flashlayout_<IMAGE>/extensible/FlashLayout_sdcard_<>.tsv
 
 USB speed   : High Speed (480MBit/s)
 Manuf. ID   : STMicroelectronics
 Product ID  : DFU in HS Mode @Device ID /0x501, @Revision ID /0x1001
 ...
```  

> Common error may occur due to wrong directories in **tsv** file. You may need to move up **two levels** example: ***fip/ -> ../../fip/***

If everything went ok you should see a message on your terminal.  

```console
Start operation done successfully at partition 0x13
Flashing service completed successfully
```  

### Flashing directly with DD 

Now let's get back to the **scripts/** folder we mentionned earlier. This folder provides a script that can be used to generate a raw image to be flashed directly to the **micro SD-Car** using the ***disk/data duplicator*** command **(dd)**. Let's change dirctory to the **scripts/** folder then:  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ ./create_sdcard_from_flashlayout.sh ../flashlayout_<IMAGE>/FlashLayout_sdcard_<>.tsv 
```  
This script will create a complete raw image using the partitions and binaries' paths mentionned in the **tsv** file.  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ sudo umount /dev/mmcblkX
```
> Removing the card without unmounting it can result in data loss.  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ sudo dd if=../flashlayout_<>_FlashLayout_sdcard_<>.raw of=/dev/mmcblkX bs=8M conv=fdatasync status=progress
```

And there it is enjoy image is flashed, enjoy the fruit of your work. But to really make it enjoyable will need a powerful to let us **Minicom**.  

Minicom is a popular text-based terminal emulator program primarily used in Unix-like operating systems like Linux. It allows users to communicate with external devices connected via serial ports.

So connect the **STLINK** to your USB port, locate the corresponding **tty** interface under **/dev**. Set the switches so your board boots from **SD-Card** then launch **minicom** on your **PC**.  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ sudo apt install minicom
ak47@ak47:$ minicom -D /dev/ttyACMx
```

Now that we got familiar with our tools and environment let's get to the real deal.  

## Project's Context  

Imagine this scenario; You're working on a custom product based on the $\color{Aqua}{STM32MP135}$ $\color{Aqua}{Microprocessor}$. For wireless communication over **Wi-Fi** your custom will be equipped with the [Grove Wifi v2](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-UART_Wifi_V2/) from [@seeedstudio](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio). And to easily interact with the module we will develop its own **Kernel Module** and a **Command Line Interface** and make an **in-tree** device.  

- **Key Steps**:
    - 
    **1. Modify the DT: Enable the UART instance connected to the module**   
    **2. Modify the DT: Make the module an in-tree device**   
    **3. Develop the Kernel Module**  
    **4. Develop the Command Line Interface**
