## Say Cheez üì∏  

We will take our first image, or build our first image i should say. First of we will follow the steps provided in this [Distribution Pckg](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/STM32MPU_Distribution_Package) to setup our environment.  

> If you're not familiar with **OpenSTLinux** distribution i recommend starting with the [Starter Pckg](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/STM32MP13_Discovery_kits_-_Starter_Package). Note that to deal efficiently with the distribution package, basic knowledge of **Yocto** is required, check this [repo](https://github.com/AKhadhraoui47/Yocto_Rpi_IMU?tab=readme-ov-file#yocto-project) where ressources are provided.  

After setting-up your workspace let's setup our build environment. A provided script in the package will do the work for us, we just need to source it with some parameters.  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ DISTRO=openstlinux-weston MACHINE=stm32mp13-disco IMAGE=st-image-core  source layers/meta-st/scripts/envsetup.sh build-dir-name
```
> Parameters are of my choice according to the hardware available to test everything is OK. Full list of provided parameters is [here](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/OpenSTLinux_distribution).  

> Mentionning the **build-dir-name** when sourcing the setup file is recommended to avoid any errors caused by path strings length.  

Sourcing the file will take us automatically to the build directory where we launch our build process with **bitbake**.  
```console
ak47@ak47:$ bitbake <image>
```
> In case we didn't mention the **IMAGE** parameter when sourcing our file we will have to mention it when launching the build.  

Once the build is complete, we will flash our **SD-Card**. Two ways will be covered; Our device in DFU Mode through USB OTG port or Flash the image directly to SD-Card from host machine but first let's check some key files under **DIR=build-dir/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/machine/**  

```
DIR --- arm-trusted-firmware/
    --- kernel/ 
    --- optee/
    --- fip/
    --- flashlayout_<IMAGE>/
    --- scripts/ 
```  

These directories contain the binaries of every element of our image, essential for a correct booting. You can check the [boot sequence](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/Boot_chain_overview#STM32MP13_boot_chain) for the MP13 series.  

> **scripts/** will be covered later. **flashlayout_<IMAGE>/** is used to locate binaries and set the partionning provided by **tsv** file used by **STM32CubeProgrammer**.

### DFU Mode  

To flash our image with our device set in DFU Mode we will need the right combination. An explanatory [table](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/STM32MP135x-DK_-_hardware_description#Boot_related_switches) is provided. <sub>Forced USB/UART boot
for programming</sub>  

Now let's flash the image using **STM32CubeProgrammer**. First let's check if our device is detected:  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ STM32_Programmer_CLI -l usb
Total number of available STM32 device in DFU mode: 1

  Device Index           : USB1
  USB Bus Number         : 
  USB Address Number     : 
  ...
```  

Now let's pass the **STM32CubeProgrammer** our device and the **tsv** file to flash our image on to the **SD-Card**.  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=usb1 -w flashlayout_<IMAGE>/extensible/FlashLayout_sdcard_<>.tsv
 
 USB speed   : High Speed (480MBit/s)
 Manuf. ID   : STMicroelectronics
 Product ID  : DFU in HS Mode @Device ID /0x501, @Revision ID /0x1001
 ...
```  

> Common error may occur due to wrong directories in **tsv** file. You may need to move up **two levels** example: ***fip/ -> ../../fip/***

If everything went ok you should see a message on your terminal.  

```console
Start operation done successfully at partition 0x13
Flashing service completed successfully
```  

### Flashing directly with DD üíæ

Now let's get back to the **scripts/** folder we mentionned earlier. This folder provides a script that can be used to generate a raw image to be flashed directly to the **micro SD-Car** using the ***disk/data duplicator*** command **(dd)**. Let's change dirctory to the **scripts/** folder then:  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ ./create_sdcard_from_flashlayout.sh ../flashlayout_<IMAGE>/FlashLayout_sdcard_<>.tsv 
```  
This script will create a complete raw image using the partitions and binaries' paths mentionned in the **tsv** file.  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ sudo umount /dev/mmcblkX
```
> Removing the card without unmounting it can result in data loss.  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ sudo dd if=../flashlayout_<>_FlashLayout_sdcard_<>.raw of=/dev/mmcblkX bs=8M conv=fdatasync status=progress
```

And there it is enjoy image is flashed, enjoy the fruit of your work. But to really make it enjoyable will need a powerful to let us **Minicom**.  

Minicom is a popular text-based terminal emulator program primarily used in Unix-like operating systems like Linux. It allows users to communicate with external devices connected via serial ports.

So connect the **STLINK** to your USB port, locate the corresponding **tty** interface under **/dev**. Set the switches so your board boots from **SD-Card** then launch **minicom** on your **PC**.  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ sudo apt install minicom
ak47@ak47:$ minicom -D /dev/ttyACMx
```

Now that we got familiar with our tools and environment let's get to the real deal.  

## Project's Context üí°

Imagine this scenario; You're working on a custom product based on the $\color{Aqua}{STM32MP135}$ $\color{Aqua}{Microprocessor}$. For wireless communication over **Wi-Fi** your custom will be equipped with the [Grove Wifi v2](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-UART_Wifi_V2/) from [@seeedstudio](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio). And to easily interact with the module we will develop its own **Kernel Module** and a **Command Line Interface** and make an **in-tree** device.  

- **Key Steps**:
    - 
    **1. Modify the DT: Enable the UART instance connected to the module**   
    **2. Modify the DT: Make the module an in-tree device**   
    **3. Develop the Kernel Module**  
    **4. Develop the Command Line Interface**  

### Enabling UART instance ‚òëÔ∏è

Let's understand the data structure we will be modifying which is the $\color{Aqua}{Device}$ $\color{Aqua}{Tree}$. It is a data structure in embedded systems that tells the operating system about the hardware components and their configuration. Similar to how a BIOS provides essential hardware information at boot, the DT helps the OS manage hardware without hardcoding specifics, offering more flexibility across platforms.

The UART instance i am working on is the UART8 instance initially **disabled**. That's why we will be applying a patch.   

**1. Copy the DT device_tree.dts we will be modifying to a tmp/ directory**  
**2. Copy in the same tmp/ device_tree.dts for example device_tree.dts.ref for reference**  
**3. Modify the device_tree.dts to enable UART8**   
**4. Generate the patch and copy to the folder in your custom layer**  

```console
ak47@ak47:$ cp build-mp135/tmp-glibc/work-shared/<machine>/kernel-source/arch/arm/boot/dts/stm32mp135f-dk.dts ~/tmp/stm32mp135f-dk.dts
ak47@ak47:~/tmp/$ cp stm32mp135f-dk.dts stm32mp135f-dk.dts.ref
ak47@ak47:~/tmp/$ nano stm32mp135f-dk.dts 

&uart8 {
	pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep", "idle";
	pinctrl-0 = <&uart8_pins_a>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&uart8_sleep_pins_a>;
	pinctrl-2 = <&uart8_idle_pins_a>;
	/delete-property/dmas;
	/delete-property/dma-names;
	//status = "disabled";
    status = "okay";
}
```
After modifying our file we will use **git** to compare and generate a file marking all differences in a **patch** file that will be applied in order to avoid modifying the original file  

```console
ak47@ak47:~/tmp/$ git diff --no-index stm32mp135f-dk.dts stm32mp135f-dk.dts.ref > 0001-Patch-File.patch
```
And there it is our patch file will look something like this [patch file](meta-custom/recipes-kernel/linux/stm32mp1/0001-enable-uart8.patch)  

> The mentionned files in the **patch** file will be directing to **tmp/** folder change that to:   
*a/arch/arm/boot/dts/stm32mp135f-dk.dts*  
*b/arch/arm/boot/dts/stm32mp135f-dk.dts*  

Now move your patch to your custom layer. Check this repo for more informations about [layers manipulation](https://github.com/AKhadhraoui47/Yocto_Rpi_IMU?tab=readme-ov-file#project-study).  

### Include the grove Module in DT  

Same process as done to enable the UART8 instance will be repeated but the content is different. To tell the kernel that our [Grove Wifi v2](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-UART_Wifi_V2/) is wired to UART8 we need to introduce the device as a **child-node** of the UART8 node.  

```
&uart8 {
	pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep", "idle";
	pinctrl-0 = <&uart8_pins_a>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&uart8_sleep_pins_a>;
	pinctrl-2 = <&uart8_idle_pins_a>;
	/delete-property/dmas;
	/delete-property/dma-names;
	status = "okay";
	current-speed = <115200>;

	grovewifi: grovewifiv2 {
		compatible = "seeedstudio,grovewifiv2";
		status = "okay";
	};
};
```
So our final device-tree will look something like this [one](build-mp13/stm32mp135f-dk.dts).

> The **compatible** binding is used to make correspondance between the device and its **kernel module** which we will see later

### Recipe For Patches  

A simple **bbappend** [recipe](meta-custom/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-stm32mp_%25.bbappend) will ensure applying those before compiling the **device-tree** into a **device-tree blob** that will extend the original kernel recipe.  

### Kernel Module  

A detailed comprehensive [documentation](https://github.com/AKhadhraoui47/Kernel_Modules) is provided about kernel development and the structure of the [module](meta-custom/recipes-kernel/grovewifi/files/grovewifiv2.c) i have developed..  

> Note that the correspondance between the hardware declared in the device-tree and the kernel module is ensured through [of_device_id struct](https://github.com/AKhadhraoui47/Kernel_Modules?tab=readme-ov-file#5-open-firmware-device-id).  

Now that our source code is ready we will need two things: 

- [Makefile](meta-custom/recipes-kernel/grovewifi/files/Makefile): This make will process our kernel module to turn it into a **kernel object**  

- [Recipe](meta-custom/recipes-kernel/grovewifi/grovewifiv2-modules_1.0.bb): The recipe ensures that **make** process is done over **cross-compilattion** then installed under the right directory.  

> If you're not familiar with **Makefile** and the **make** build tool check this **[repo](https://github.com/AKhadhraoui47/Yocto_Rpi_IMU?tab=readme-ov-file#makefile)**.  

#### The recipe ü•¢  

Let's go through the main components of this particular [Recipe](meta-custom/recipes-kernel/grovewifi/grovewifiv2-modules_1.0.bb).  

```
inherit modules
```  

This line tells Yocto to inherit the module class, which contains common functions and behaviors used for building Linux kernel modules.  

```
EXTRA_OEMAKE:append:task-install = " -C ${STAGING_KERNEL_DIR} M=${S}"
EXTRA_OEMAKE += "KDIR=${STAGING_KERNEL_DIR}"
```  
$\color{aqua}{EXTRA}$ $\color{aqua}{OEMAKE}$ : Additional GNU make options.  
$\color{aqua}{:append:task-install}$: This restricts the additional options to the "install" task (When the compiled kernel module is installed to its final location).  
$\color{aqua}{-C}$ $\color{aqua}{STAGING}$ $\color{aqua}{KERNEL}$ $\color{aqua}{DIR}$: Tells make to change to the kernel's staging directory, which contains the kernel headers and build scripts needed for the module.  
$\color{aqua}{M=}$ : Specifies the module source code directory, so make knows where to look for the module‚Äôs source files.  

Now to interact with our module an under-improvement CLI is provided.  

### Command Line Interface  

A [CLI](meta-custom/recipes-kernel/grovewifi/files/grovewifi_cli.c) written in C is provided as a built-in feature in our generated image is provided. This CLI exploits the **[Sysfs](https://github.com/AKhadhraoui47/Kernel_Modules?tab=readme-ov-file#b-sysfs-interface)** entries to communicate with the kernel module. 

This CLI provides the commands below  

```
grovewifi_CLI --chk-state /*Returns if the state is OK or Not*/
grovewifi_CLI --connect <ssid> <pwd> /*Returns connection is established*/
grovewifi_CLI --disconnect /*Returns if operation is successful or not*/
grovewifi_CLI --get-ip /*Returns your IP addr*/
grovewifi_CLI --get-ip <IP or Host> /*Returns ok or not*/ 
```
> Note that this CLI is under improvement and "successful operation" and "unsuccessful operation" are the provided responses. 

#### The recipe ü•¢  

Let's go through the main components of this [Recipe](meta-custom/recipes-kernel/grovewifi/grovewifiv2-cli_1.0.bb).  

```
do_compile() {
         ${CC} grovewifi_cli.c -o grovewifi_CLI
}
```

This function is used to cross-compile the source code into binary that will be installed in our target image through:  

```
do_install() {
         install -d ${D}${bindir}
         install -m 0755 grovewifi_CLI ${D}${bindir}
}
```

The first line command installs the **bindir** which references **/usr/bin**   
The second line installs the executable with specific permissions under this directory  

## Demo üéûÔ∏è  

Let's go for a demo showcasing the outcome of our hardwork. after building and flashing.
